->IF THE PARENT CLASS'S CONSTRUCTOR GOT A PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR, THEN WHILE MAKING THE    CONSTRUCTOR THE  CHILD CLASS'S , WE NEED THE WRITE THE SUPER(<ARGUMENTS>) AS THE FIRST LINE.

   IF THE PARENT CLASS'S CONSTRUCTOR DOESNT HAVE ANY PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR THEN,WHILE      MAKING THE CHILD CLASS'S CONSTRUCTOR IT AUTOMATICALLY CALLS THE PARENT CLASS'S    CONSTRUCTOR,    AND NO NEED TO USE SUPER.
-> Method overloading is when methods with same naame havinbf diff paramters,no of parametrs or order different WITHIN THE SAME CLASS.
But Method overriding is when methods having same name and exactly same attributes, WITHIN DIFFERENT CLASSES.
