=> Abstract functions/methods are those methods which we just declare but don't wrote its implementation.

=> Abstract classes are classes which contain the abstract methods, are intended for the purpose of being used by a child class.If we dont implement the abstract methods 
   in the child class then it gives us an error.

=> Abstract classes can have normal methods,but need atleast one abstract method.While abstract method can be written only inside an abstract class.

=> Syntax:
    abstract class <class_name>
    {
        abstract <data_type> <method_name>();
    }
